redux makes the satte managment easier
makes ur life much easier when it comes to large application
can access from other page as well and manage it
the reducer holds functionality to modify the state
it has type(name),and payload(the operation it need to perform)
redux is
1) single state tree-all state of entire app resides in one large state
2)state is read only ..just describing
3)reducers are pure fns
(state,action(type,payload))...then returns a new state..//doesnt modift it but returns a new one
